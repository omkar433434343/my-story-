There was a cap seller in a city. He used to go from village to village to sell the caps. His way lay through a forest.

It was a hot summer day and it was very hot. He got tired. To get some rest he sat under a shaded tree. Soon he fell asleep under the shadow of the tree. Many monkeys were living on that tree. When they saw the caps they climbed down the tree and each one of them put a cap on their head. Then they climbed up the tree again.
